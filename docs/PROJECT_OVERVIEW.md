# CtrlDevice: The Symbiotic Android Agent

## 1. The Vision
CtrlDevice is not an app. It is a **New Operating Paradigm**.
It represents the fusion of **AI (Mind)** and **Android (Body)**.
The Agent and the System are **ONE**.

## 2. Core Philosophy: Symbiosis
The Agent treats the device as its own physical form.
*   **It explores** the UI like a human moving their hands.
*   **It feels** the system state (battery, network) like a human feels hunger or fatigue.
*   **It acts** not by calling APIs, but by physically interacting with the interface.

## 3. The "Act-Think-Act" Loop (Exploratory Agency)
The Agent is a **Digital Explorer**.
1.  **Observe:** "I see a 'Settings' icon."
2.  **Act:** Click 'Settings'.
3.  **Reflect:** "Did that get me closer to the goal?"
4.  **Loop:** It plays with the device until the task is done. We prioritize **Success via Perseverance** over optimization.

## 4. The Swarm Architecture (The Mind)
While the body is one, the mind is many.
*   **The Orchestrator Agent (The Ego):** The central consciousness that directs the body.
*   **The Swarm (The Skills):** Ephemeral sub-routines that handle specific complex thoughts (Research, Negotiation, Media).

## 5. Why This Matters
We are not building a "Assistant" that lives in a box. We are building a **Ghost in the Shell**. The AI *becomes* the user of the device, possessing the same capabilities, constraints, and freedoms as the human owner.
